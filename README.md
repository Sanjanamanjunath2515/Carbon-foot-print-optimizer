## üìñ Overview

**Carbon Footprint Optimizer** leverages machine learning to predict CO‚ÇÇ emissions based on logistics data such as distance, fuel consumption, load weight, and route parameters. It enables businesses to gain insights into their carbon output and make data-driven decisions to reduce emissions.

---

## üåü Features

- Predicts CO‚ÇÇ emissions from logistic routes
- Scales to custom datasets with multiple features
- Built using a clean and modular TensorFlow/Keras model
- Easily deployable and customizable for real-world logistics scenarios

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset `logistics_emission_data.csv` includes logistics-related features such as:

- Distance Traveled  
- Vehicle Load  
- Fuel Consumption  
- Route Type  
- CO‚ÇÇ Emissions *(Target variable)*

Ensure all columns are clean and numeric for optimal model performance.

## üß† Model Architecture

The model is defined in `model.py` using TensorFlow/Keras:

```python
Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1)
])
````

* **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
* **Optimizer**: Adam
* **Metrics**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Clone the repository and install required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/carbon-footprint-optimizer.git
cd carbon-footprint-optimizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### 1. Prepare Data

Update your dataset and ensure the target column (e.g., `co2_emissions`) is clearly labeled.

### 2. Train the Model

```python
from model import build_model
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('logistics_emission_data.csv')
X = df.drop('co2_emissions', axis=1)  # replace with actual column
y = df['co2_emissions']

# Preprocess
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = build_model(input_shape=X_train.shape[1])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, validation_split=0.2)
```

---

## üìà Results

Evaluate the model on your test data:

```python
loss, mae = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Test MAE: {mae:.2f}")
```

You can also export the model using:

```python
model.save("carbon_model.h5")
```
